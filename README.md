## Coffee Shop Management

##### 1) There is a promotion, when you order 2 lattes, you will receive a free espresso. This is already implemented. 
* Our users complains this feature does not always work.

##### 2) Print the Menu:

| Product Name | Price |
| :---: | :---: |
| Latte | $ 5.3 |
| Espresso | $ 4 |
| Sandwich | $10.10 |

##### 3) We need to add a new promotion: 
  * 5% discount on the total, if the order have more than 8 products. 
  * Only one promotion is active, the cheapest for the client.
  
##### 4) Add the following product list:

| Product Name | Price |
| :---: | :---: |
| Capuccino | $ 8 |
| Tea | $ 6.1 |
| Cake Slice | $ 9 |
| Milk | $ 1 | 

##### 4) When the order has food and drinks with total value over $ 50, which Latte will cost $3.
* The calculated value can be under $ 50.

##### 5) Add the client concept, so it will be possible to create orders for more than one client.
